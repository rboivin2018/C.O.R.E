# System Architecture

The robotics platform follows a modular, layered architecture to support various robot types while maximizing code reuse.

## Core Architecture Components

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Isolates hardware-specific implementations from the rest of the system:

- Actuator interfaces
- Sensor interfaces
- Communication interfaces

### Core System

- State Management
- Safety Systems
- Configuration
- Logging

### Perception Systems

- Sensor Fusion
- Object Detection
- Environment Mapping

### Planning

- Path Planning
- Motion Planning
- Task Planning

### Control

- Controllers
- Kinematics
- Dynamics

### Common Services

- Localization
- Mapping
- Navigation
- Diagnostics

### Robot-Specific Implementations

- Drone-specific modules
- Arm-specific modules
- Mobile robot modules
